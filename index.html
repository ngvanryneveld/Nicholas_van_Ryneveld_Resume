		Bio:
	</h2>
		<p>
		  I am an energetic, charismatic and vibrant person who thrives in social surroundings. I enjoy the outdoors, physical exercise and spending quality time with people. I work hard and try my best as I enjoy acquiring new skills and trades that I can share and use.
		</p>
		<p>
			My motivation comes from wanting to create something in terms of a career. I have been fortunate enough to have many various experiences and want to use what I have learnt in a way to better other lives. This could be done in many ways, through my current software development course, through my Honors degree knowledge or in an ideal world, using a combination of the two.

	Education:
</h2>
	<p>
		I was raised in Cape Town and went to both Prep school and High school in the mothercity. After matriculating in 2015, I enrolled into my BSc degree at the University of Cape Town in 2016. My major was in Property Studies and I finished my undergraduate in 2018. The following year I furthered my degree and finished my Honors year in Property Studies. After finishing honors I felt that along my tertiary education journey I had found many other fields interesting that I wanted to explore, one of which was computer programming and so in 2020 I enrolled in a Software Development course through HyperionDev.
	</p>
	<p>
		My plans for the near future are to try and continue to educate myself in some fields that I feel will be valauble in the world that is constantly evolving around us. I feel like computer programming is only the start of my journey in honing in some crucial skills that would hold me in good stead. I also feel like the education journey will be furthered through work experience which I intend to start soon in vairous forms.

<h2 id="Work Experience">
	Work Experience:
</h2>
	<p>
		 My current experience is very limited in the fields that interest me.  My work experience includes working in the service industry and as a high-school tutor for various subjects. I feel while I haven't yet started my career in any way, my currect work experience has allowed me to gain many important skills. Working in the service industry means that there is a high importance placed on team work in order for a restuarant to perform. In this, individual performance is what drives such team work and I think that being in such a high intensity job position, teaches valuable lessons about how to dig deep when times are tough. Through working as a tutor, I have learnt skills in patience and the ability to teach. This proves ever so important in an environment that is stressful or hard to grasp. I like that I have confidence in myself in the ability to learn and that I am patient in doing so.

	Lifestyle:
	</h2>
		<p>
			In my normal life, I am a social and outdoor type of person. I enjoy kitesurfing and take any chances with the Summer winds in Cape Town to get onto the water. I play club football both 11 and 5 a side and also play golf. I am a big foodie and in turn have completed a basic cooking course, but am planning on furthering this. I feel sports help to build character for a person too, both individual skills and team skills. The social aspect gets me most excited and meeting new people through it is great fun while ensuring I keep some level of fitness.
